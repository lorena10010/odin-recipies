    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <h3>For the Shrimp</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the pasta according to the package
             directions for al dente while you cook
              the shrimp.</li>

        <li>Toss the shrimp with the paprika, Italian
             seasoning, salt, and pepper in a medium 
             bowl until they're evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Heat the sun-dried tomato oil in a large 
            skillet over medium heat. Then, cook the 
            shrimp for two minutes on both sides until
             they are pink, opaque, and C-shaped. If 
             they're O-shaped, you've cooked them too
              long.</li>
        <li>Set the cooked shrimp aside to cool.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>For the Sauce</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter in the same pan over 
            medium-low heat. Then, add the garlic,
             onion, sun-dried tomatoes, tomato paste,
              Italian seasoning, paprika, salt, and
               dried basil. Cook the mixture for about
                two minutes until fragrant.</li>

        <li>Add the flour to the aromatics and stir
             well. Then, add the broth, heavy cream,
             and spinach. Stir and cook until the
              sauce thickens and the spinach starts
               to wilt - about 5 minutes. Then, add
                the parmesan cheese and stir until
                 melted.</li>
        <li>arefully mix the pasta into the sauce. 
            Then, add the shrimp and gently stir
