        <li>8 oz egg noodles, el dente</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Cook the beef:  Place a large skillet on 
            the stove and heat 2 Tablespoons of olive 
            oil over medium-high heat. Add 1 pound of
            ground beef to the skillet. As the beef 
            cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up
            into small pieces. Continue cooking 
            until the beef is mostly browned, with
            only a bit of pink remaining. Don’t 
            drain any grease from the skillet, 
            as it will add flavor to the sauce.</li>

        <li>Sauté the Vegetables: Reduce the heat to
            medium. In the same skillet with the beef,
            add the sliced mushrooms and diced onions.
            Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally,
            until the onions are soft and the mushrooms are
            golden. Add the minced garlic, dried thyme, 
            kosher salt, smoked paprika, and a few cracks
             of fresh black pepper. Stir well, and cook for
              another 1-2 minutes, or until you can smell
               the garlic and spices.</li>

        <li>Thicken with Flour and Broth: Sprinkle 2
             Tablespoons of flour over the vegetables
              and beef mixture. Stir constantly for 1-2
               minutes to ensure the flour is fully absorbed,
                forming a thick paste. Slowly pour in 2 cups
                 of beef broth, stirring continuously to avoid
                  any lumps. Scrape any brown bits off the
                   bottom of the pan. Increase the heat
                    slightly to bring the mixture to a
                     gentle boil, then cook for about 2
                      minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken
                       slightly.</li>

        <li>dd Flavorings & Pasta: Add the Worcestershire 
            sauce, Dijon mustard, and soy sauce to the skillet,
             stirring until everything is combined. Add the 
             cooked egg noodles to the skillet and gently stir
              them into the sauce, making sure the noodles are
               coated evenly.</li>
               
        <li>Finish with Sour Cream: Turn off the heat and add
             the sour cream to the skillet. Stir until the sour
              cream is fully incorporated into the sauce, 
              creating a smooth and creamy texture. If the 
              sauce seems too thick, add a splash of broth or 
              pasta water to thin it out to your desired 
              consistency.</li>
