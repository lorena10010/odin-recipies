# odin-recipies
 <p>For the odin-recipies project, I will be building
 a simple website using HTML to demonstrate my 
 understanding of core concepts. I will start with the
 basic HTML !DOCTYPE html, html, head, and body tags. I will add paragraphs using the p tag
 and insert comments with !-- -- to explain my code.</p>

 <p>I will create links to other pages on my website and potentially other links on the web using the a herf="" tags and use target=blank"" along with 
 rel= "noopener noreferrer" to enhance security when linking to external sites. </p>
 
 <p>I will use various HTML elements like headings, lists and images and applied attributes to control their behavior and apperance. Finally, I will push my code to github by staging my changes with git add, and committing with git commit -m "message", and using git push to upload the project. </p>
